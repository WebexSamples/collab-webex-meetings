## Step 3: Retrieve a user's scheduled meetings list

> Webex XML Services URL

```http
https://apidemoeu.Webex.com/WBXService/XMLService
```

Retrieving a list of meetings via the `LstsummaryMeeting` request is very similar to the previous `CreateMeeting` operation.  The listing is of meetings belonging to the Webex user ID specified in the `<header>`, along with selection, sorting and paging options present in the `<body>`

For this request we will request to have the results ordered by meeting start time:

**LstsummaryMeeting XML Request**

```xml
<serv:message xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <header>
    <securityContext>
      <WebexID>test_user</WebexID>
      <password>cisco!123</password>
      <siteName>apidemoeu</siteName>
    </securityContext>
  </header>
  <body>
    <bodyContent
      xsi:type="java:com.Webex.service.binding.meeting.LstsummaryMeeting">
      <order>
        <orderBy>STARTTIME</orderBy>
      </order>
    </bodyContent>
  </body>
</serv:message>
```

Let's test it out:

1. In Postman, construct a new `POST` request, as before:
  * In the field marked **Enter request URL** put the URL for the Webex Sandbox XML Service (see the URL listed above)
  * From the request method dropdown box, make sure **POST** is selected
  * Select the **raw** body type button
  * Enter the XML for the LstsummaryMeeting request into the body text box (copy/paste the code example above)

2. If you've provisioned a user of your own in the Webex sandbox lab, go ahead and replace the values in the `<WebexID>` and `<password>` fields in the XML

3. Click the **Send** button to launch the request

Take a look at the XML data returned.  If everything went well, you should see a **SUCCESS** result:

```xml
<serv:result>SUCCESS</serv:result>
```

as well as a listing of the users meetings (i.e. the one created in the previous step), including the meeting key(s):

```xml
<meet:meetingkey>622095259</meet:meetingkey>
```
