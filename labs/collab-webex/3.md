## Step 3: Retrieve a user's listing of WebEx meetings

> WebEx XML Services URL

```http
https://apidemoeu.webex.com/WBXService/XMLService
```

Retrieving a list of meetings via the `LstsummaryMeeting` request is very similar to the previous `CreateMeeting` operation.  The listing is of meetings belonging to the WebEx user ID specified in the `<header>`, along with selection, sorting and paging options present in the `<body>`

For this request we will specify only to have the results ordered by start time:

> LstsummaryMeeting XML Request

```xml
<serv:message xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <header>
    <securityContext>
      <webExID>test_user</webExID>
      <password>cisco!123</password>
      <siteName>apidemoeu</siteName>
    </securityContext>
  </header>
  <body>
    <bodyContent
      xsi:type="java:com.webex.service.binding.meeting.LstsummaryMeeting">
      <order>
        <orderBy>STARTTIME</orderBy>
      </order>
    </bodyContent>
  </body>
</serv:message>
```

1. Open the Postman REST client plugin: in the browser, click the ![Apps](/posts/files/collab-webex/images/apps_icon.png) button on the shortcut toolbar, then select 'Postman - REST Client'.  (If necessary, click the **_Reset_** button to clear any previously entered info.)

2. Construct a POST request for the WebEx XML Services URL
  * In the field marked **_Enter request URL here_** put the URL for the WebEx Sandbox XML Service (see the URL listed above)
  * From the request method dropdown box, make sure **_POST_** is selected
  * Select the **_raw_** body type button
  * Enter the XML for the LstsummaryMeeting request into the body text box (copy/paste the code example above)

3. Click the **_Send_** button to launch the request

Take a look at the XML data returned.  If everything went well, you should see a **SUCCESS** result:

```xml
<serv:result>SUCCESS</serv:result>
```

as well as a listing of the users meetings, including the meeting key(s):

```xml
<meet:meetingkey>622095259</meet:meetingkey>
```
