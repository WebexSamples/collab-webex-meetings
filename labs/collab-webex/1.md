# Cisco Webex Meetings - Automate and integrate online meetings using the Webex XML API

## Objective

Use the Cisco Webex Meetings XML API to create an online meeting, list a user's scheduled meetings, invite an attendee via email, and list meeting recordings.

## Overview

Cisco <a href="http://http://www.webex.com/" target="\_blank">Webex</a> is a global cloud collaboration service, delivering HD audio/video conferencing, screen/document sharing, recording and more in a secure and scalable platform.  While Webex provides a spectrum of capabilities across multiple APIs - covering user/admin tasks, recordings management, site/capabilities configuration, etc. - that enable developers to integrate and augment their applications with Webex, in this exercise we will use the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/Webex-developer/develop-test/xml-api/overview/" target="\_blank">Webex XML Meeting Service</a> to perform some simple but powerful tasks focused on the end-user experience.

The Webex XML Services are accessed by sending XML over HTTP requests, and are therefore easy to leverage from almost any development platform: web, PC, mobile, etc.  While the APIs are not really RESTful (historically predating REST), a REST client tool can be helpful when testing and working with Webex XML Services - in this exercise we will use the 'Postman' REST client (<a href="http://www.getpostman.com/" target="\_blank">http://www.getpostman.com</a> for more info on Postman).

## Step 1: Explore the Webex Meetings API site on DevNet

> DevNet website URL (<a href="https://developer.cisco.com" target="\_blank">link</a>)

```
https://developer.cisco.com
```

1) From the DevNet home page at `developer.cisco.com` use the browser to navigate to the micro site for the Collaboration technology 'Webex Meetings API'

> Webex website URL (<a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/webex-developer/web-conferencing/" target="\_blank">link</a>)

```
https://developer.cisco.com/site/webex-developer/web-conferencing/
```

2) Explore the Webex Meetings developer pages and check out the available documentation, tools and developer community

3) Check out the DevNet Webex Sandbox - This exercise is written for use with the shared Webex developer sandbox site **apidemoeu.webex.com**.  Information on accessing and provisioning a free developer account in this environment can be found in the [DevNet Sandbox Webex Lab](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/0116f65c-a600-474c-b47d-57ed6a180248?diagramType=Topology)
