# Cisco WebEx Meetings - Automate and integrate WebEx online meetings using the WebEx XML API

## Objective

Use the Cisco WebEx Meetings XML API to create an online meeting, list a user's meetings, and invite an attendee via email

## Overview

Cisco <a href="http://http://www.webex.com/" target="_blank">WebEx</a> is a global cloud collaboration service, delivering HD audio/video conferencing, screen/document sharing, recording and more in a secure and scalable solution.  While WebEx provides a spectrum of capabilities across multiple APIs - covering user/admin tasks, recordings management, site/capabilities configuration, etc. - to enable developers to integrate and augment their applications with WebEx.  In this exercise we will use the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/webex-developer/develop-test/xml-api/overview/" target="_blank">WebEx XML Meeting Service</a> to perform some simple but powerful tasks focused on the end-user experience.

The WebEx XML Services are accessed by sending XML over HTTP requests, and are therefore easy to leverage from almost any development platform: web, PC, mobile, etc.  While the APIs are not RESTful (historically predating REST), a REST client tool can be helpful when testing and working with WebEx XML Services - in this exercise we will use the 'Postman' REST client plugin pre-installed in the Chrome browser (<a href="http://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">http://www.getpostman.com/</a> for more info on Postman).
