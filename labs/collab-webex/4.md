## Step 4: Add an attendee to an existing meeting

> WebEx XML Services URL

```http
https://apidemoeu.webex.com/WBXService/XMLService
```

Once a meeting has been created, it is possible to later modify the meeting options - for example to add attendees - via the `SetMeeting` request.

Similar to the previous requests, a security context is provided in the `<header>`.  An XML `<body>` indicates which meeting to modify and the updated options requested.  

The main required element is the `<meetingKey>` element.  If you didn't save the meeting key from Step 2, you may want to revisit that step and create a new meeting to use, or re-list the meetings as in Step 3 to find the meeting key.

To add an attendee, the email address can be given in the `<participants>` element, as below.  You can change the dummy email address in the sample code to your own email - you should receive an invitation!

We are also specifying the `<emailInvitations>` option to enable sending out email invites, and the `<openTime>` option to allow attendees to join/start the meeting early without the host:

```

1. Open the Postman REST client plugin: in the browser, click the ![Apps](/posts/files/collab-webex/images/apps_icon.png) button on the shortcut toolbar, then select 'Postman - REST Client'.  (If necessary, click the **_Reset_** button to clear any previously entered info.)

2. Construct a POST request for the WebEx XML Services URL
  * In the field marked **_Enter request URL here_** put the URL for the WebEx Sandbox XML Service (see the URL listed above)
  * From the request method dropdown box, make sure **_POST_** is selected
  * Select the **_raw_** body type button
  * Enter the XML for the SetMeeting request into the body text box (copy/paste the code example above) **You may want to change the email address to your own!**

3. Click the **_Send_** button to launch the request

Take a look at the XML data returned.  If everything went well, you should see a **SUCCESS** result:

```xml
<serv:result>SUCCESS</serv:result>
```

If you provided your email address and have an Android or iPhone, you can install the Cisco WebEx app from your phone's app store, check your email for the invite, and confirm your work!
