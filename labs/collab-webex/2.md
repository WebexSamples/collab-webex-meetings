## Step 2: Create a Webex online meeting

> Webex XML Services URL

```http
https://apidemoeu.Webex.com/WBXService/XMLService
```

The Webex Meeting service request `CreateMeeting` is used to create an online meeting.  Making the request involves sending an HTTP `POST` request to the Webex XML Services URL (above), which contains a XML document that includes the user credentials in the `<header>` and meeting details in the `<body>`.  

For this sample request, we will specify only the meeting name ('Sample Meeting') and a empty start time (which defaults to 'now'):

**CreateMeeting XML Request**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<serv:message xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
	<header>
		<securityContext>
			<WebexID>test_user</WebexID>
			<password>cisco!123</password>
			<siteName>apidemoeu</siteName>
		</securityContext>
	</header>
	<body>
		<bodyContent xsi:type="java:com.Webex.service.binding.meeting.CreateMeeting">
			<metaData>
				<confName>Sample Meeting</confName>
			</metaData>
			<schedule>
				<startDate/>
			</schedule>
		</bodyContent>
	</body>
</serv:message>
```

Let's try this request using a REST client:

1. Open the Postman REST client (If necessary, click the **Reset** button to clear any previously entered info)

2. Construct a `POST` request for the Webex XML Services URL:
	* In the field marked **Enter request URL** put the URL for the Webex Sandbox XML Service (see the URL listed above)
	* From the request method dropdown box, make sure **POST** is selected
	* Select the **raw** body type button
	* Enter the XML for the CreateMeeting request into the body text box (copy/paste the code example above)

3. If you've provisioned a user of your own in the Webex sandbox lab, go ahead and replace the values in the `<WebexID>` and `<password>` fields in the XML

4. Click the **Send** button to launch the request

Take a look at the XML data returned.  If everything went well, you should see a **SUCCESS** result:

```xml
<serv:result>SUCCESS</serv:result>
```

as well as the meeting key for the newly created meeting:

```xml
<meet:meetingkey>622095259</meet:meetingkey>
```

Make a note of the meeting key for use in later steps. You can use this [note-box page](notebox.html) to copy/paste the key.
