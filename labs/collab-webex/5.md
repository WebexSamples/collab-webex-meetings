## Step 5: Deleting a meeting

> Webex XML Services URL

```http
https://apidemoeu.Webex.com/WBXService/XMLService
```

To tidy up, we can use the `DelMeeting` request to remove the meeting we created in Step 2.

The main required element is the `<meetingKey>` element.  If you didn't save the meeting key from Step 2, you may want to revisit that step and create a new meeting to use, or re-list the meetings as in Step 3 to find the meeting key.

**DelMeeting XML Request**

```xml
<serv:message xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
	<header>
		<securityContext>
			<WebexID>test_user</WebexID>
			<password>cisco!123</password>
			<siteName>apidemoeu</siteName>
		</securityContext>
	</header>
	<body>
		<bodyContent
			xsi:type="java:com.Webex.service.binding.meeting.DelMeeting">
			<meetingKey>622677325</meetingKey>
		</bodyContent>
	</body>
</serv:message>
```

1. In Postman, construct a `POST` request for the Webex XML Services URL
	* In the field marked **_Enter request URL** put the URL for the Webex Sandbox XML Service (see the URL listed above)
	* From the request method dropdown box, make sure **POST** is selected
	* Select the **raw** body type button
	* Enter the XML for the DelMeeting request into the body text box (copy/paste the code example above)

3. Click the **Send** button to launch the request

Take a look at the XML data returned.  If everything went well, you should see a **SUCCESS** result:

```xml
<serv:result>SUCCESS</serv:result>
```

(Note: if you joined the meeting from your smart phone during Step 4, you may get an error message when trying to use `DelMeeting`, as the meeting may still be 'in progress'.  By default the meeting will be automatically deleted when it ends, so feel free to ignore this message.)
