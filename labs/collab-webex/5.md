## Step 5: Housekeeping - Deleting a meeting

> WebEx XML Services URL

```http
https://apidemoeu.webex.com/WBXService/XMLService
```

To tidy up, we can use the `DelMeeting` request to remove the meeting we created in Step 2.

The main required element is the `<meetingKey>` element.  If you didn't save the meeting key from Step 2, you may want to revisit that step and create a new meeting to use, or re-list the meetings as in Step 3 to find the meeting key.

> DelMeeting XML Request

```xml
<serv:message xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
	<header>
		<securityContext>
			<webExID>test_user</webExID>

```

1. Open the Postman REST client plugin: in the browser, click the ![Apps](/posts/files/collab-webex/images/apps_icon.png) button on the shortcut toolbar, then select 'Postman - REST Client'.  (If necessary, click the **_Reset_** button to clear any previously entered info.)

2. Construct a POST request for the WebEx XML Services URL
	* In the field marked **_Enter request URL here_** put the URL for the WebEx Sandbox XML Service (see the URL listed above)
	* From the request method dropdown box, make sure **_POST_** is selected
	* Select the **_raw_** body type button
	* Enter the XML for the DelMeeting request into the body text box (copy/paste the code example above)

3. Click the **_Send_** button to launch the request

Take a look at the XML data returned.  If everything went well, you should see a **SUCCESS** result:

```xml
<serv:result>SUCCESS</serv:result>
```

(Note: if you joined the meeting from your smart phone during Step 4, you may get an error message when trying to use `DelMeeting`, as the meeting may still be 'in progress'.  By default the meeting will be automatically deleted when it ends, so feel free to ignore this message.)
